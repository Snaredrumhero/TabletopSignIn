This app is built on .net 6. If you try and launch the app and it says no, install the .net 6 desktop runtime found at this link:
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0

Installing the SDK would also do the trick, but that's a much bigger file, stick with the runtime.

You'll need to set up officer IDs for officers to log in, but the default login is "GamesRFun1804". There is no submit button, but it'll log you in when you press enter.
